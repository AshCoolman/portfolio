HIGH PRIORITY
180	Slow down?
60	Transitions
240	Better looking (add dimension)
90	Event driven script
		Subtitle ending events:
			Should the Route detect end of subtitle and tell a nav (alt being Nav detects all subtitle end events)? Yes, because it is controlling this phenomenon
			And many things could cause the Nav to show/hide


LOW PRIORITY
45	Split script newlines on '/n/r' etc instead of '.'
Change ControlWithVars to not have second attribute as a "model", instead check that model="adf" would work.
